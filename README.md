# Network-Topology-Simulation

Overview
This project explores and simulates different network topologies—Star, Ring, and Bus—using Tcl and Nam in a network simulation environment. The objective is to analyze and compare the efficiency, fault tolerance, and scalability of these topologies.

By leveraging simulation tools, we construct virtual networks that allow us to study network behavior, packet transmission, and topology performance under different conditions.

Features
✅ Simulations for Star, Ring, and Bus network topologies
✅ Tcl scripting for defining network behavior
✅ Network Animator (Nam) for visualizing network activity
✅ Packet flow analysis for understanding data transmission
✅ Scalability and fault tolerance testing
✅ User interface with topology visualization

Technologies Used
Tcl (Tool Command Language) – for scripting network simulation
Nam (Network Animator) – for visualizing network activity
NS-2 (Network Simulator) – for simulating network protocols and topology behavior
Virtualization (VMware/VirtualBox) – for running simulations in an isolated environment
